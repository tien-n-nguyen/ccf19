\textbf{SON: INTRO THE PROBLEM}

\textbf{Overview}
Based on these observations, we propose a novel approach for
configuration-dependent fault localization. The input includes 
the buggy configurable code, the~test result of each
configuration, and the trace of the executed~statements that are
recorded for each test in each configuration, e.g., the trace of the
executed statements in $c_7$ is shown in Fig.~\ref{execution_trace}.

%
In general, to localize a configuration-dependent bug, our algorithm
works in three steps as shown in Fig.~\ref{workflow}.

%
In preprocessor-based program families \cite{kastner2012virtual}, a 
feature selection is controlled by one or more \textit{configuration 
options} (macro symbols). In the example, the feature \texttt{LOCKDEP} 
is controlled by the configuration option \texttt{CONFIG\_LOCKDEP}.
%
In a configurable system, the selections of features are used to specify
particular configurations (variants) of the system.
%
%Configuration
\begin{Definition}{({\bf Configuration}).}
In a configurable system consisting of the set of features $F$, a 
configuration $c$ is a particular set of the selections of all 
features in $F$. We denote $\mathbb{C}$ as the set of all possible 
configurations of the system.
\end{Definition}

In practice, a {\em configuration-dependent} bug can be revealed
during testing, in which there are configurations failing at least
one test, while others pass all their tests.
%
For example, the bug in Fig.~\ref{example_bug} is revealed only in
$c_2$ and $c_7$ in which the features \texttt{LOCKDEP},
\texttt{PPC\_256K\_PAGES}, \texttt{!SLOB}, and \texttt{SLAB} are all
enabled and \texttt{PPC\_16K\_PAGES} is disabled.
%
In highly configurable systems, most of reported bugs  are 
configuration-dependent faults that are only exposed under a set of 
certain configurations \cite{Abal:2018} \cite{Garvin:2011}. 

%

\begin{Definition}{({\bf Configuration-dependent Fault}).}
In a configurable system, a fault of the system is considered as a
configuration-dependent bug if only if there are two non-overlapping
partitions of configurations $CP$ and $CF$, where $CP, CF \subsetneq
\mathbb{C}$, $CF \cup CP = \mathbb{C}$, and $CF \cap CP = \emptyset$,
such that all configurations in $CP$ execute as expected, while all
configurations in $CF$ reveal the bug.
\end{Definition}

\begin{Definition}{({\bf Configuration-dependent Fault Localization}).}
Given buggy configurable code, the test result of each configuration,
and the trace of the executed statements that are recorded for each
test in each configuration, configuration-dependent fault localization
is to output the ranked list of statement(s) that are likely to cause
the fault(s).

\subsubsection{Suspicious Statement Detection}
\label{statement_detection_section}

For a configuration-dependent bug visible by a $SPC$, not only the 
statements that implement the interactions of the features in the 
$SPC$ are likely to be buggy, the executed statements in the failed 
configurations that have dependency impact on them could be suspicious 
as well ({\bf O3} and {\bf O4}).
%considered to be suspicious.
%

Given a $SPC$ of a particular bug, let $ES$ be the set of the statements
that implement the interactions between the enabled features ($f_E$s)
in $SPC$; $DS$ be the set of statements that implement the
interactions of $f_E$s with the disabled features ($f_D$s) in $SPC$.
%
In case that there is no $f_D$ ($DS=\emptyset$), if a statement $smt$
has impact on any statement in $ES$, it is considered as
suspicious. However, in the case that $DS \neq \emptyset$, $smt$ is
considered to be faulty only if $smt$ also has dependency impact on at
least one statement in $DS$. Indeed, because if $smt$ has no
dependency impact on any interaction between $f_E$s and $f_D$s, the
impact of $smt$ is not hidden by any $f_D$ when the features in $f_D$s
are enabled ({\bf O3}).

For the running example, the statements that implement the
interactions of \texttt{SLAB}, \texttt{PPC\_256K\_PAGES},
\texttt{LOCKDEP}, and \texttt{\!SLOB} whose enabling make the bug
visible ($ES$) are the statements at lines 4, 11--12, 16, 22, and
24. These statements are also executed in $c_7$, a failed
configuration, and obviously have impact on the interaction between
features in $ES$.
%
Additionally, another statement that has impact on the interaction is
line 1, and it is also suspicious. However, only the statements at
line 1, 11--12, and 22 have impact on the interactions between
\texttt{PPC\_16K\_PAGES} and the features in $ES$. As a result, for
the bug shown in Fig.~\ref{example_bug}, they are the only suspicious
statements.

\textbf{Suspicious statements ranking.} To rank these suspicious
statements, we analyze the execution information in the testing phase
to assign a suspiciousness score to each of these statements. This
could be realized using spectrum-based
techniques~\cite{wong2009survey}. We use a spectrum-based
tool to access the suspiciousness for only the set of detected
suspicious statements, rather than using them for all executed
statements. Take Tarantula~\cite{tarantula} as an example, the
suspiciousness score of a suspicious statement $stm$:
$$
Suspiciousness(stm) = \frac{N_{CF}/N_F}{N_{CF}/N_F+N_{CS}/N_S}
$$
where:
\begin{itemize}
\item $N_F$ total number of failed test cases
\item $N_S$ total number of successful test cases
\item $N_{CF}$ number of failed test cases that cover $stm$
\item $N_{CS}$ number of successful test cases that cover $stm$
\end{itemize}
