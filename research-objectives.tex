\subsection{Research Objectives and Anticipated Results}
\label{research-objectives-section}


This is a proposal is to investigate and develop {\bf a scientific
  foundation and a novel methodology for ...}.

%
In order to achieve our vision, we need to address fundamental
research problems:

\noindent \textbf{Task 1. Scientific foundation for the representation for feature-interaction and feature-interaction detection.}  
  
%
%

\noindent {\bf Task 2. A benchmark of configuration-dependent defects in configurable code.} 


%
%


\noindent {\bf Task 3. The applications of the benchmark in quality assurance for configurable code.}
