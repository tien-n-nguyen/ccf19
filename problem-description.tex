The importance of configurable code: almost every software system is configurable (give a number)

The quality assurance activities (testing, bug detecting) for configurable code are also crucial.

Despite its clear criticality, numerous case studies have shown that defects in configurable code 
can be difficult to detect in practice, primarily because the configuration-dependence of the 
defects and testing all possible configurations is prohibitively costly.

Despite the success of..., the prior studies focused on their own corpus of configuration-dependent faults.

The existing benchmarks for non-configurable code such as SIR or TraceLab...

The existing benchmarks of configuration-related defects are still limited:

- Abal's corpus contains 98 bugs in Linux, Apache HTTP, Busybox and Marlin

- Medeiros's corpus contains 135 bugs

$\implies$ Lack a standard for the QA studies (disconnected)

$\implies$ At the same time, advances have been hindered by the lack of a publicly significant research 
benchmark of configuration-dependent defects. New researchers entering the field must invest significant time to...
