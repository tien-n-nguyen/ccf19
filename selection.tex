Input: Configurable system and a set of known configuration-dependent bugs

Output: A effective and efficient set of selected configurations

Effectiveness: Maximize the number of bugs covered by the selected set configurations

Efficiency: Minimize the number of configuration selected for testing

The idea is the configuration-dependent bugs are caused by the interactions between features (including the core feature). 
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Detect interactions between features

	\item Define a feature interaction coverage

	\item Select the set of configurations that maximize the defined coverage
\end{enumerate}
